# Revature Dogs
Angelica Velez, Russell David Gehan, Abraham Bergerson

Introduction: 

Revature Dogs is a simple yet incredibly entertaining game where you can adopt any number of dogs and
interact with them at your own leisure. Watch them grow from a pup into a legendary great wolf perhaps?
In this game, you will need to fulfill your pet’s needs. This includes feeding them, walking them, and giving
them attention. You better watch out though, because your dogs will die if you fail to take care of them!
This game will also have features such as the ability to train your pet various tricks, so that you can improve
your score and compare it with other players.

Value Proposition: 

This project will provide our novice team with experience using the tools and techniques that are
currently used in real world applications and project design. In addition, we will learn about the
importance of DevOps when working in a team environment as well as the value of tools such as
SonarCloud and Microsoft Azure for project deployment and publishing. We will learn the value of
single-page applications implementing API and Angular techniques using best practices.

Extensible Features:
- A Dog Status feature could describe how close our dog is to becoming a legendary dog. For example, a dog that’s learned every trick in the book before a certain age can become a legendary dog. Legendary dogs can have an increased life expectancy or none at all so that they can live forever!
- An in-game currency feature could allow players to “purchase” in-game items, such as: dog food, treats, and toys. Players should be able to earn currency by teaching their dogs new tricks or participating in competitions.
- Competitions could be a fun way for players to have their dogs compete by performing tricks so that they can win prizes, such as in-game currency or rare in-game items.
